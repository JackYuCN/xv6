1. page 0 contains the text&data information; 
   page 2 contains the user stack; 
   user cannot read/write page 1 beacause its PTE_U flag is not set, actually it serves as the guard page of the user stack.

2. prevent the overflow problem
   example: 
       p->sz = 10, srcva = 1(000...01), len = 2^64 - 1(111...11)
       srcva < p->sz 
       srcva + len = (000...00) < p->sz
     but
       srcva + len < srcva
